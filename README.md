# FARVR

The following is a repository containing a library used to optimize and simplify the manufacturing process of furniture design. FARVR is a research project initiated by me in the UCLA LEMUR Research Lab. Beginning on June 2018, the research project involves designing an API used to interact with furniture on Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality utilities. The ultimate goal is to design a collaborative Mixed Reality environment where multiple designers can interact in a common space and design manufacturable furniture together.
